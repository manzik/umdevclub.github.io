## Deployment

Every time a commit is made to the `main` branch, the react source code is automatically built and published to the `gh-pages` branch, which is then used to serve the users. So you don't need to worry about deployment of your code: As long as your changes are in `main` codebase, they will be reflected on the actual website within 1-3 minutes.
